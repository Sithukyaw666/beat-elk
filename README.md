# Elastic Stack (ELK) for Observability

## Introduction

The Elastic Stack, formerly known as the ELK Stack, is a comprehensive solution for centralized logging and observability. It consists of the following core components:

-   **Elasticsearch**: A distributed engine for search and analytics    
-   **Logstash**: A pipeline for collecting, processing, and forwarding data    
-   **Kibana**: A powerful interface for data visualization and dashboard    
-   **Beats**: Lightweight data shippers, including Filebeat, Metricbeat, and Auditbeat
    

Together, these tools provide a full-featured observability platform capable of handling logs, metrics, and traces across distributed systems.

----------

## The Three Pillars of Observability

Observability is built on three key elements:

-   **Metrics** help determine _what_ went wrong
-   **Logs** help understand _why_ it went wrong  
-   **Traces** help identify _where_ it went wrong
    

Elastic Stack offers solid support for all three, particularly excelling in log and metric collection and analysis.

## Advantages of Elastic Stack

Elastic Stack provides several benefits:
-   It supports powerful full-text search and filtering through Elasticsearch    
-   Kibana enables rich and interactive visualizations  
-   Beats and Logstash make data ingestion seamless and flexible  
-   It is scalable and suitable for production environments
    

----------

## Limitations

Despite its strengths, Elastic Stack comes with trade-offs:

-   It consumes substantial system resources due to the nature of full-text indexing
-   Scaling the stack can become expensive in terms of CPU, memory, and disk usage





----------

## A Lightweight Alternative: The LGTM Stack

For use cases that don't require the heavy indexing and analytical power of Elasticsearch, a more lightweight alternative exists in the LGTM stack:

-   **Loki** provides efficient log aggregation using a label-based approach rather than full-text indexing
-   **Grafana** serves as a unified dashboard for metrics, logs, and traces
-   **Tempo** offers distributed tracing capabilities with low overhead
-   **Mimir** delivers scalable metrics collection and is fully Prometheus-compatible

## Why Choose LGTM?

The LGTM stack is ideal for modern, cloud-native applications. It offers:

-   Lower resource consumption compared to Elastic Stack
-   Better fit for microservices and containerized environments
-   Native integration with OpenTelemetry and other observability standards
